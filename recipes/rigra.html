    <h1>Riz au Gras</h1>
    <p>
        The national dish of Burkina Faso is riz gras or 'oily rice' in French. <br>
        This dish originates in Senegal but is commonplace throughout <br>
        West Africa with Burkinab√© people making it their own. <br>
        The name comes from the overly plentiful amount of oil <br> 
        used in the cooking process.</p>

    <h2>Stepes to cook a nice Riz Gras dish</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the habaneros, garlic, tomatoes and onion into a food processor and pulse until you get a nice paste. Then heat the oil over medium heat and add the paste to the pan. Cook for 8 minutes, then remove from the fire and set aside.</li>
        <li>Use a little bit of water (about 1/2 to 1 cup) to rinse out your food processor, then put the water in a separate pot along with the meat. Bring the meat and water to a boil, then reduce heat. Simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the meat (fish chicken beef) to the pan containing the paste. Add the tomato paste, water and Maggi (or stock) cube. Stir.</li>
        <li>Wash the rice until the water runs clear. Then add it to the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and let simmer for 15 minutes. Check it, then cook for another 10 minutes or until the water has been absorbed.</li>
        <li>Garnish with thin slices of onion.</li>
    </ol>
